# Numerical-analysis  
This repository contains multiple jupiter notebooks, each dealing with a theme of numerical analysis, and exposing several approaches to solve the given problem.

These notebooks have been realized within the numerical analysis course at the Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau - France).  

The topics covered are :  
- Solving non linear equations  
- Numerical integration  
- Interpolation and polynomial approximation  
- Numerical integration  
- Gradient methods  
- Ordinary differential equations  
- Partial differential equations
